# words

A shoddy, bodged response to -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4BMR88260

words_alpha.txt is the same file Tom used containing all the words.

wordcheck.py is the extremely bad, inefficient Python code.
I originally was also printing every word that was discarded to the console (noted by the commented lines) - extremely slow.

firstdump.txt contains the console dump of the first version of the code, in which I and O were allowed.

seconddump.txt contains the console dump of the second version of the code, in which I and O are not allowed.
